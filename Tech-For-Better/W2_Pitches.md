## Product Pitches

### []() - Ann

#### About / Notes

- Ann is a hardware engineer
- Plan to use a beacon that the users can tap their phone on (like scanning in at uni)
- Could have an app where they put into info and store it into a cloud
- Could differenciate from an immediate need or other need
- Venues would have to have a complimentary tool (beacon),
- Could add a function to just ask questions (messaging)
- No working prototype currently
- Currently you would have to be reliant on a venue having assistive technology or the staff having training with accessibility

#### Problem

- **Aim**: Enable disabled/access needs let a venue know about their disability/ access need prior to getting there, so venue and staff know this
- Timescales: Users could scan a beacon at the venue to let them know, or let them know in advance.
- Ann has done research with Chesterfield FC, chesterfield musuem, college and uni buildings, etc.
- Have looked at outdoor events (e.g. festivals)
- Beacons: would cost the venue around Â£30, battery could last around 3 years - but must be changed on a yearly basis
- In turn could maintain the app on a yearly basis - update venue outlines
- MVP: Information about the venue, messaging service
- Beacon could be a QR
- Looking into user testing
