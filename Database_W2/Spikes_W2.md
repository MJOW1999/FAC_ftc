# Continuous integration

## Questions

### 1. What is continuous integration (the methodology)? What is a continuous integration _server_?

Continuous integration (CI) is a software practice that requires frequently committing code to a shared repository. Committing code more often detects errors sooner and reduces the amount of code a developer needs to debug when finding the source of an error. Frequent code updates also make it easier to merge changes from different members of a software development team. This is great for developers, who can spend more time writing code and less time debugging errors or resolving merge conflicts.

### 2. Why might we want to run our tests whenever we push code to our repo?
